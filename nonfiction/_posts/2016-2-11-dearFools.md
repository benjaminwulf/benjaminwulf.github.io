Dear Fools:

My capacity to excel in the position is noted on my CV and web portfolio via:

[http://wulf.io/about](http://wulf.io/about).

Writing cover letters is actually becoming somewhat of a hobby for me. I have enough saved up that I am considering a resume / cover letter writing a possible source of income… maybe Bill Gates said it best, "…choose a lazy person who does a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it."

That said—I don't want to draw parallels, there are obviously much smarter people than me, most recently employed as a stock boy for seasonal employment. But I will say that for my short period managing the shipments often exceeding 100 boxes three times weekly into a 10 x 10 unventilated off sight storage room, I excelled. Starbucks subsidiary Teavana invested nearly 1,500 USD in my ideas, rearranging, adding two new shelving units, and upgrading from a pushcart with two flat wheels to the convertible Gemini you see FEDEX and UPS operate with ease.

While I no longer work for SBUX, their capital to labor ratio on my 9.50 wage exceeded 3/2.  In fact, I was two credits shy of an economics major at one point in time, but as my economics history professor said, which has been said many moon prior was, "wherever you go, there you are." He inspired me so much I wrote my term paper on a comparative analysis between the socialist economist, Robert Owen's and the movie _Easy Rider_.

In summary:

This is my second time applying to you. Last time, it was maybe off the cuff, on a whim for the job title of Freelance Financial Analyst / Writer. I made the second round with two tightly written pieces, one long on Under Armor and other short on Whole Foods. I appreciated the nice note back, even though it didn't work out.

I believe I am qualified for entry to tier 2-3 positions in IT administration as well as I have a unique voice in writing and have one self published book and a comic book on the way!

Regards,

Benjamin W Wulf (aka Benji)
