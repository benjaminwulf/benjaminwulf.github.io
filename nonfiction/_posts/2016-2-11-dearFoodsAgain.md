Dear Fools:

It is with thrice pleasure I write to you, although this sample writing is only my second attempt to gain freelance employment with financial / creative writing.

Who: Call me Benji but my fool username is benGT0 (that's pronounced Benjito w/ a zero.

What: With the name Benji and one folly in infomercials I believe I have what it takes. Oh… I have study economics, finance, and have two immediate family members that are CPA types. Oh… I don't. But I have a unique voice like the late great Billy Mays. And When I write for you, I feel like Bradley Cooper taking EZT in limitless—okay maybe that's a stretch—but it is past 4:30am—and—I will make deadlines.

Where: Remote.

When: I would feel comfortable with 2 to three assignments per week to start. I want to grow into more, but I'd rather not under deliver up front.

How: I write things that you are interested in and/or you buzz me half a dozen tickers with a day to digest and I spit it back in digital type font.

In summary:

Last time I applied for the job title of Freelance Financial Analyst / Writer. I made the second round with two tightly written pieces. One I wrote long on Under Armor and other short on Whole Foods. I appreciated the nice note back that I might be better qualified for your social media, etc. I believe I can give stronger fundamentals about financials to make the cut this time without forgoing my writer's voice.

Regards,

Benjamin W wulf (aka Benji)
