### _54-Year-Old Pumps 4,321 Pull-Ups Into Guinness Book of Records_

At age 54, Mark Jordan breaks the existing 24-hour pull-up record, writing himself into Guinness Book of Records. That is 4,321 bicep busting reaches to be exact. More than 20 years older than the average NFL player, Mr. Mark Jordan record is a freak of nature. Maybe he has found the fountain of youth. Perhaps singularity is interwoven into his DNA. Younger testosterone driven males have simultaneously trained in attempting to break the same record. One 27-year old, Mike McCastle, of Washington state attempted only to rupture capillaries around repetition 800.

Most people will not attempt 400 pull-ups in a lifetime. Averaging over 200 pull-ups hour, that's enough index finger keyboard strokes the committee judge nearly escaped carpal tunnel syndrome. Meanwhile, other judges were forced to remain in the seated position on folding chairs and sleep deprived.

The gym owner of CC CrossFit in Corpus Christi sees Mark Jordan as a 54-year _Phenom_, coming in every morning and turning into an absolute machine. As the world absolute physical pull-up specimen, Mr. Jordan ripped out 575 chin-ups in the first two hours. The new record holder believes setting pace is key in preventing burn out. Having charity behind him played key his in motivation and 1-year journey of preparation. HELP or the Hammonds Education Leadership Program united with Jordan in raising awareness in assisting in new career training.

Behind every successful pull-up stud is a strategically high amp musical playlist, most notably, Van Halen's Jump on repeat. To reduce fatigue between each set, Jordan's trademark 3 pectoral flexes keeps him motivated on the prize, an impromptu print off in faded ink. But non-the-less, he will get his name in 8-point type font, if no contenders challenge his feat before the next Guinness Book of Records hard bound.

It will only be a matter of time before Mark Jordan will have a 24-hour motivation makeover. Maybe a website with 24-hours-of-pull-ups is in the works? We can only hope and wish him success.
