<p>The Shell Gaming Dominion Project, aka SGDM for short, has been one intriguing ride. The current novel is being rebooted into three graphic issues in hopes of becoming a serial release. With 3 adapted scripts copy edited, I am willing to share my pains in trying to get a graphic series off the ground.</p>

<p>For starters, writing a 250 page novel is easier. That said, why?</p>

<ol>
  <li>In novel writing the only main constraint is time</li>
  <li>Comic pages cost money (art, lettering, coloring)</li>
  <li>Most writing in a comic script is only for artist, layout, etc</li>
</ol>

<p>I decided giving the artist more creative interpretation is better, being presently surprised with the outcome when the restraints are removed. That said, if a layout or cell isnâ€™t what you have in mind, you are going to have to wait longer and possible shell out more money.</p>

<p>Enjoy the pre lettered stage art from issue 001 of Shell Gaming Dominion!</p>
