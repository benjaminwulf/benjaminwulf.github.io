<p>Not sure how to describe the emotions seeping out my pores. NASA, NOAA, NSA came to me to design what is only being referred to as the c2025. In short the c2025 is a conceptual super computer. Seems that that the articles that travel via the US Patent office are not only the most impressive in a scale of invention and innovation, but as espionage and shell warfare. See—the modern day version of tomb raiders are in fact corporate and state sponsored hackers.</p>

<p>Because I really don’t know how to put this—computers no longer think in ones and zeros, bin, binary, obsolete. I have written a new source code that can search world patents like Facebook tags your photo. Incredible valuable, it predict a person potential in ways an IQ test is irrelevant.</p>

<p>To spit is simply; think of a touch dial phone. 1 and 0 exclusive, an abstracted layer of computing, only needed for information not living in a software level of programming. 2 thru 9 or 8 bit throughputs can be resolved to the entire English 26 letter alphabet via various levels of hertz signals. I’ll stop before I ware you to sleep. Point overall is that to go 10x faster you need an algorithm faster than 2.5 thousand trillion calculations a second. To surpass the current record holder will take a little ingenuity. To put it in perspective, the output of 7,000 graphics processors and 14,000 Intel chips needs to be squeezed into a more manageable computing hierarchy and it all begins with a Tor network of encrypted computing power.</p>

<p>You might remember BlackBerry, 10 years ago, as it’s market cap stumbled, a investing consortium purchased it, Pebble, and Sprint.  The Turing phone became the platform with replacing obsolescent Blackberry’s.  I currently run on Gen_A Beowulf or 11 for you none hex thinkers.  My name is Leo Dvorak and my consultancy is called SGDM. A lame acronym from back when the net was younger, much younger, when there was only one web, firewalls and shell gaming was a more two dimensional warfare.  In yr 2025, entire nets are like VPN tunnels that run underneath a must bigger manifestation.  Yes—the undernet exist, but to each is an opposite the overnet makes for 5 autonomous web caved areas still holding the legacy naming:</p>
