<p><strong>Summary: Project Koeppen</strong></p>

<p>In light of spree school shootings, terrorist plots, and organized cyber attacks, the National Security Agency is combing profiles of persons with mental illness. In hope to get inside the ill mind, Project Köppen is set to harness mindset lone wolves before prior to rogue. The National Security Agency favors potentially hiring on confidential contractor basis. Work authorization is currently forbidden under precedence of Standard Form 86 to hire any persons whom received consultation for emotional or mental health condition and/or has been hospitalized for serious and persistent conditions. The National Security Agency seeks executive order to on board one individual on trial basis and assume all risk involved on TOP SECRET CLASSIFICATION.</p>

<p>Belle:</p>

<p>Explain the scope of Project Köppen before we table it indefinitely.</p>

<p>Warsaw:</p>

<p>We are seeking Phase II or contacting said individual anonymously.</p>

<p>Belle:</p>

<p>Yes-yes. Who would have thought Anonymous would become such a simple recruiting tactic of our Agency? How are you going to reach said person—though Wikipedia or something more obscure?</p>

<p>Warsaw:</p>

<p>Give the nature—far more obscure! We need to test how said person deals under stress. In all—I’d say standard identity hijacking, followed by prolonged surveillance—bait the individual with a real scenario and see where they run?</p>

<p>Belle:</p>

<p>Okay—one thing prior to me giving this initiative an upward push? How would one know the difference between the two acts at hand? Won’t it look like hacker vs hacker?</p>

<p>Warsaw:</p>

<p>Indeed—that is the nature. In the event of a quagmire, we have CIA assistance preauthorized. It’s the only way to test the unknown.</p>

<p>Belle:</p>

<p>Are there any informants in place?</p>

<p>Warsaw:</p>

<p>Yes—a stripper under the name Ruby.</p>

<p>Belle:</p>

<p>Damn-it-all… bare flesh again? And on American soil for an American civilian. Henrike, you better treat this case with utmost care. If anything goes awry, you notify me immediately—this will need to be spun all as another delusional character off meds and we’ll see they are force fed enough pharma they only color in crayon—got it?</p>

<p>Warsaw:</p>

<p>Yes m’am.</p>

<p>Belle:</p>

<p>Do you have a subject in mind?</p>

<p>Warsaw:</p>

<p>There is one. He is highly sedated now but I think he can be awakened.</p>
