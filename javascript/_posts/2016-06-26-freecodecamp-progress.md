freeCodeCamp
------------

Get involved in a programmers community
=======================================

[Track my progress on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/benjaminwulf)

While I successfully completed over 250 exercises, it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert. One of my biggest weaknesses with learning programming is once I get somewhat success in accomplishing one thing it lead to the requirement of understanding another. For example: In learning HTML, one doesn't get far without utilizing JavaScript. And soon enough you might want structured data, requiring understanding of SQL databases and queries. Then to bring the data to life in a web browser, JQuery is required. All this leads to two distict problems in my learning.

One: A type of ADD multitasking in which I never really comprehend what I'm doing but somehow glue a web page together.

Two: The more systemic problem is creating a rigorous schedule and maintaining interest in one programming language.
