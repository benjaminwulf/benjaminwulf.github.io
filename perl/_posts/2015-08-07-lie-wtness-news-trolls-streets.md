### _Lie Witness News Trolls Streets of Hollywood Degrading Unknowing Bystanders_

Mad props to the interviewer of this video clip testing tourist current event knowledge up and down Hollywood Boulevard. Being the savvy Jeopardy type that answers Kevin Tabec in question form, this is for you. Okay, perhaps you are the bar trivia type. You will love it too. If you don't know the local syndicated listing for Jeopardy, there are _yo mamma jokes_!

Spanning everything from Russian - USA relations to circumcision of a fictional presidential baby, traveling folk are dumfounded up and down the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ironically the most knowledgeable reply comes from a teenager, clamming Dennis Rodman is too inexperience to be ambassador to North Korea. Just when you want to root her on in sincerity, she recalls eating clam chowder at the time she heard the news. Fail. Hope she wasn't visiting with the Harvard MENSA chapter for the nearby conference? One woman believes Kim Jung-il and President Obama enjoyed movie _Titanic_ together. _Joe Cool_ T-shirt guy likes Obama's supposed new ear piecing, but warns young voters it's only to be hip. _Joe Cool_ is Peanuts comic strip smoking alter ego of Snoopy. Unimportant to enjoyment, but B.B King even wrote a ditty about a Snoopy so cool he wore sunglasses at night.

Try to reserve from yelling obscenities in a tweaking fashion and instead LOL at these citizen civic blunders. In all honesty, give kudos to their vivid imaginations. Isn't that why America is so great! Land where inert pieces of LEGO's become a blockbuster movie, Batman and Superman can share the same big screen, and Taco Bell adds Cap'n Crunch Berries as an ingratiate to ever expanding menu. Perhaps it is a warning we all should begin reading the subtitles of Headline News next time on an airport layover or glace down newspaper cover story in a Starbucks.
