Are you the type of individual that does one thing in the GUI and questions whether you could instead use the shell? If you answered yes, chances are Oysttyer is for you. An open source Perl application, Oysttyer allows you to stream tweets and direct messages in the terminal.

If you have not worked with an API before, this is quite honestly the easiest way to begin. Utilizing the twitter REST API, I recommend the Oysttyer help guide below to generate oathkey and oathkeysecret:

After setup is complete, lauch app:

```perl oysttyer.pl```
