_Is Whole Foods Market dividend sustainable?_

Once a common joke of college age millennial's, Whole Foods Market more honestly should be named _Whole Paycheck_. But that was when GMO free foods where difficult to come by and with credit cards in hand, everything appears to be possible, buying Odwalla juices and sitting cross-legged in our barren Ikea furnished apartments. Saturdays were a toss up between treating our bodies like a temple or instead jay walking to buy red solo cups for the night ahead.

Each week wavered between being thrifty hipster or pretending we could afford overpriced nourishment. With the thermostat permanently stuck at 55 degrees all winter, at least our organic foods stayed fresh longer. But then competition like Trader Joe's moved into the neighborhood. It was more convenient. Surely they didn't have everything but those debit card swipes began to make sense. We cut up the credit cards offering pirate loot we would never see, gave of the leased automobiles. Practicality started to sink in.

Around that same time, January 2, 2004, Whole Foods, paid out its first quarter dividend of $.015, rising as high to $0.25 in 2005. The most recent quarterly dividend sits at $0.13. WFM pays out yearly $0.52 (1.30 %), more than twice the yield of competitor Kroger. But can that last? With the recent stock price pull back, is Whole Foods Market having an identity crisis?

Whole Foods total cash equivalences have dropped from $1,023 billion on September 29, 2013 to most recently hovering at $776 million April 12, 2015. The company has opened 32 new stores in 2013 and 27 in 2014, back to back year growth of 9 percent, but are the stores too large and not what the shopping demographic? There are more and more choices in health and organic foods.

Trader Joe's, owned by German Billionaire Karl Albrecht's, the same man that brought us ALDI is challenging Whole Foods shopping demographics. While people never thought ALDI might never take flight in America, Albrecht has rapidly changed the way people shop. This is the same guy that even charges a deposit for a shopping cart, but have you ever seen one lying around vacant in an ALDI's parking lot.

Trader Joe's have an average footprint of 12-15,000 square feet. Whole Foods in comparison recorded a footprint averaged 43,000 square feet in 2013 and 2014. This year to date something interesting is occurring, the average size of Whole Foods Market has scaled down 37,000 square feet. Whole Foods and Trader Joes operated 442 and 460 stores respectively. With bigger footprint comes more food spoilage, more employees, and higher leasing cost. In a market segment known for snobby clientele, Whole wants to keep those customers _paycheck_ but at the same time not drive everyone else down the road to ring the appreciation bell at Trader Joe's. Competition is spouting up everywhere too. Sprouts Farmer Market is one, plus every major grocery chains are finally getting their act together and offering many of the same quality foods at similar pricing. In the smaller footprint, Trader Joe's outsells other groceries two times over. Not to mention they carry 4,000 items, which it seam almost all are private labeled, _cha-ching!_

Whole foods understand the competition and are trying to boost confidence. It has repurchase 578 million shares of common stock last year. But recently the company was accused of over charging customers in New York and California resulting in lawsuits. Co-CEOs John Mackey and Walter Robb apologized, but it does not help the company image. Investors rarely like when companies have co-CEOs at the helm. Who's making the direction?

A smaller version of their stores is in beta testing, but yet has been officially named. In a recent NPR spot, Anthony Dukes, marketing professor at University of Southern California's Marshall, discusses the problem Whole Foods Market is having with younger shopper. He explains that if Whole Food's want so go the route of smaller store, they should take a lesson out of Toyota's playbook. When Toyota did not want to tarnish it loyal costumers, the smaller, somewhat ugly (depending on whom you ask) car got the badge Scion.

If a Whole Food plans to open smaller stores, what happens to all the customers at the bigger stores? It is a delicate line of branding to cross. Will they need to invest significantly? Won't some shoppers just go the baby size store with cheaper organics?

Likely Whole Foods will need to reinvest significantly and the dividend will not see growth in the upcoming year. Time will tell if the new strategies take hold. They have twice offered intensive special dividends for long-term stakeholders. In the immediate future, expect cash flow to be tied up in investments to regain image and take a new expansion approach of smaller footprints.

So what should Whole Foods Market call their _half foods_ counterpart? Despite the pending name, _Half Paycheck_ sounds a little easier on the wallet.
