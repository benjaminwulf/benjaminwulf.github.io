_Under Armour Jordan Spieth Golf Shoe… SOLD OUT!_

While Nike's golf franchise faces are fizzling this season, 21-year-old Jordan Spieth dressed head to toe in Under Armour, is sizzling hot. Only the 6th player to win both the Masters and U.S. Open in the same year. 

His shoes are sold out everywhere! Sound familiar? If eBay is calling you out of curiosity, there was one 9.5 pair with a starting bid of $875 or $1,500 buy it now price. Heard of supply and demand? This short of exuberating over a pair of golf shoes has never happened. Best part about Jordan Spieth UA endorsement is he was signed to a 10-year contact in 2013. He's locked in for 8 more years. Under Armour is setting precedent to make him the face of their golfing division.

According to Golf Digest, only 35 percent of consumers knew Jordan Spieth prior to his win at the U.S. Open and a few months earlier at the Masters, only 19 percent. Spieth ranks number 1 amount athlete celebrities, up from 333rd on a pole that measuring consumers that aspire to be like celebrities. Only Tom Hanks, Bill Gates, and Kate Middleton outrank, when the survey expands to celebrities overall. Now there are two Jordan's in the list of top endorsement value.

This brings serious momentum to making Under Armor a force to be reckoned with on and off the gold course. Unlike Rory McIlroy and Tiger, whom were forced to make golf club changes to accept their contract, Jordan Spieth has the liberty to keep what works in his bag. Under Armour sees his contract as an extension of all branding, after all, Spieth is an athletic phenom, successful all sports he ventures.

With 232.0 million of cash on UA balance sheets in comparison to 5.92 at NKE, it might read like David verses Goliath. But Under Armour, now around 19 years takes plotted risk towards an ever-diversified portfolio of products.

UA trades at 95.07 P/E ratio, but it is a major growth stock. UA is up 184 percent in two years, outperforming NKE, only up 78 percent. At this rate, its three-year performance might possibly outdrive even Jordan Spieth.

Under Armour success began in high school and college locker rooms and remains on fields and tracks everywhere. But more surprisingly his how UA has found unique opportunities that other apparel companies have completely overlooked. Take for instance: UA has the Official Armed Forces collection. Somehow Nike missed this strategic partnership. Under Armour camouflage exists—brilliant! It was only a short wait until Cabala's Outfitters began packing the racks with every type of hunting related Under Armour camouflage. From long johns to mittens, and everything in between, outdoorsmen are leaving flannel behind for high tech Under Armour gear.

Despite if you enjoy University of Maryland sports or not, the flashy jerseys quickly turned Kevin Plank, CEO and Chairman of Under Armour a thorn in Nike's heel. UA is now the 2nd largest apparel company behind Nike and holds 14 percent market share with only 273 million spent in endorsements in 2014 compared to 4.7 billion for NKE.

If Nike decides to play ball, then Under Armour is ready. Mavericks President Terdemas Ussery announced he is stepping down to take a job with Under Armour. FYI. Prior to the Mavs, Ussery was president of Nike Sports Management, its marketing division.

This stock is a sound buy. Under Armour's selectiveness on where they target investment is going to be important but they have navigated impressively thus far. They need to avoid too much expansion too fast and focus on growing their upcoming niche markets that are underserved by other sport apparel companies. To be successful in golf, they need to get the shoes right. People expect a high level of performance from the existing Under Amour lineup.

The British Open is underway and once again Spieth is in the hunt. With the frigid coastal breezes, no doubt an assortment of Under Armour will keep him limber at St. Andrews, as Europeans get a look at the 25-year-old and his superior cold weather Under Armour golf apparel. Consider putting Under Armour stock in your bag.
