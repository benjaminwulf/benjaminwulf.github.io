Getting Started With Perl
=========================

This blog entry makes the assumption that you already have perl installed. If you answered NULL, simply vist:

<a href="http://learn.perl.org/installing/"></a>

Okay! Now that you have endured that, lets familiarize ourselves with the help document of Perl.

Perldoc
-------

Simply try out these commands:

```
perldoc List::Util
```

```
perldoc perltoc
```

```
perldoc Moose::Manual
```

Perhaps you noticed that ```perdoc Moose::Manual``` errors out. To fix this we utilize the cpan comman, short for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. Itis a module repository. Run ```cpan Moose::Manual``` to get a more extensive help documentation.

Perl is one of the best documentated programming languages. See *perldoc perdoc and read through to see how usefull the help is in fact.
